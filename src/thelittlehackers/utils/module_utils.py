    Return the root path of the current Python project.


    :note: The function detects whether the module has been installed as a
        3rd party library (i.e., within the directory ``site-packages``).
        In this case, any source directory would have been removed from
        the path to the module file.  Therefore, the argument
        ``source_depth`` is automatically set to ``0``.


    :param module_file_path_name: The path to the module from which this
        function is called.  This SHOULD be the Python built-in variable
        ``__file__``, which evaluates to the pathname of the current
        module.

    :param module_name: The name of the module from which this function is
        called.  This SHOULD be the Python built-in variable ``__name__``,
        which evaluates to the name of the current module.

    :param source_depth: The depth of the Python project's source directory
        from the Python project's root directory.

        Python developers usually create a ``src`` directory at the root of
        their Python project where they organize their project's modules,
        rather than putting their sources file directly in the root
        directory.  For example::

        ```text
        .
        ├── CHANGELOG.md
        ├── LICENSE.md
        ├── README.md
        ├── data

        Their ``pyproject.toml`` file contains the following instruction:

        ```toml
        packages = [{ include = "majormode", from = "src" }]
        ```

        In this case, the depth of the Python project's source directory
        is ``1``.

        This argument is automatically sets to ``0`` if the module has
        been installed as 3rd party library, in which case Python project's
        source directory has been removed from the path to this module file.
